# node-requests

Place to experiment with node requests, trying to debug them, determine best practices etc.

Sparked by https://github.com/vigour-io/adm-state-scraper-hotfix/issues/1 adm-scraper-hotfix issue where a request got a response, but the `end` event never fired, and nothing else happened.
